# Personal Website tutorial

Welcome! In the next 45 minutes, you‚Äôre going to get your first website online, and it‚Äôs going to be fabulous. It‚Äôll look something like this:

<Note style={{ marginBottom: '12pt' }}>

Check out the live demo and final code (the files `index.html` & `style.css`).

</Note>

## Part 1: Setup

All websites are written with code. To write our code, we need our own code editor. We‚Äôre going to use [repl.it](https://repl.it), a free, online code editor, since it works on all kinds of computers. It works similarly to Google Docs, but it‚Äôs optimized for typing code & will host your website.

To get started, go to <https://repl.it/languages/html>. Your coding environment will immediately spin up with some demo code.

You should be seeing a file called `index.html`, with a bunch of text covered in `<` & `>` symbols. That‚Äôs HTML, which we‚Äôre about to write!

## Part 2: HTML

Every website‚Äîfrom Reddit to the New York Times‚Äîis written in HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It ‚Äúmarks up‚Äù text with additional meaning, like ‚Äúthis line of text is a heading.‚Äù We can add non-text elements too, like images, videos, and buttons. Unlike more specialized programming languages, every computer can display HTML.

### Everything is a tag

```html
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
```

Everything in HTML is a **tag**, like this one, made up of 3 parts (or more, we‚Äôll get to that later):

1. `<h1>`: the opening tag. The name of the tag is wrapped in angled brackets (`<` & `>`)
2. `Welcome!`: the content. You can write whatever you want here!
3. `</h1>`: the closing tag. This is just like the opening tag, but has a forward slash before the tag name

Now, write your own heading!

<Editor checks={["<h1>", "</h1>"]}>

Add your name between opening `<h1>` + closing `</h1>` tags

</Editor>

### Writing tags

Repl.it gives us starter code, but let‚Äôs start fresh. Delete everything in `index.html`, then type in the following. **Do not copy & paste ü§ì**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Every webpage uses this structure. Here‚Äôs what the template means:

1. The first line, `<!DOCTYPE html>`, tells the browser we‚Äôre using HTML, and what version of HTML to expect (the latest version, HTML5, in our case)
2. `<html></html>` contains the whole page
3. `<head></head>` holds information _about_ the page (such as the title)
4. `<body></body>` contains the content, which is everything you see on the page

### Adding content

Remember that `<h1>` tag you wrote? Add one of those with your name, below `<body>`!

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Lachlan Campbell</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Click the <kbd>Run</kbd> button to see your site. You‚Äôve got your name on the page! Congratulations ü•≥

<Collapse.Group style={{ marginBottom: 48 }}>
<Collapse title="What does h1 stand for?">

H1 stands for ‚Äúheading 1.‚Äù HTML supports 6 levels of headings, with 1 being the largest. If you want a subheading, you use `<h2>`, or if you want another heading under that, `<h3`>.

</Collapse>
<Collapse title="What other tags are there?">

HTML has _hundreds_ of tags. `<h1>` is used by nearly every website, as is `<p>`. `<strong>` will make something bold, [`<a>` adds links](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a). `<div>` is a tag that has no intrinsic meaning, but it‚Äôs used all over the place for grouping elements in more complex layouts. `<button>` does what you think it will üëá

<Button theme="success" auto onClick={() => alert('Oh hey!')}>
  Click meeee
</Button>

</Collapse>
</Collapse.Group>

### Adding an image

Text is fun, but let‚Äôs add an image! First, we need to find the image:

- If you want to upload your own image,

(technically called a [void element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#syntax-elements), which means it can‚Äôt contain text)
